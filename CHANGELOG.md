In the index.php we use similiar code to that of the dashboard. The "partners" table matches to that of teh professionsls table in the database. So if we should change anything in the dashboard.php we need to make sure that the changes are reflected in the index.php as well. Otherwise we have to combine the two in such that the handlers (php or javascript) are not repeated but rather rafractored.
